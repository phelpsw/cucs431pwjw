                    <dc:description>The Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC) is the is the primary archive and distribution center of seismological data recorded by the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) . The SCEDC web site offers information in the following categories: Seismicity ---Seismicity reports for 1993 to present ---Reports on specific earthquakes Earthquake Catalogs Waveforms datasets Station Info ---List of digital and analog stations in the Southern California Seismic Network ---List of TriNet stations ---Instrument response information for stations Other Data ---GPS and Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment data ---3-D Velocity Model for Southern California Education ---Investigating Earthquakes through Regional Seismicity Education Module ---Exploring the Use of Space Technology in Earthquake Studies Education Module ---Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country Earthquake Maps ---Maps showing recent earthquakes in Southern California and historical earthquakes in Southern California ---Monthly (1996- ) and annual (1985-1998) seismicity maps and animations for Southern California ---Animation of Southern California Earthquakes, M 4.5 and greater, 1932-1997 Maps ---Crustal Deformation Velocity Map for Southern California ---Seismic Hazards Map for Southern California - Probable Earthquakes 1994-2024 ---Clickable Fault Map of Southern California</dc:description>
                    <dc:description>The Southern California Earthquake Center Data Center's mission: "To maintain an easily-accessible, well-organized, high-quality, searchable archive of earthquake data for research in seismology and earthquake engineering." At this site information is available on recent earthquakes in southern California. Automated maps with locations for earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or greater are displayed. Also, on this site: Historical earthquake information, and earthquake safety.</dc:description>
                    <dc:description>To say that there are a few earthquake research centers in Southern California is a bit like saying that Chicago sits on a lake of some size. It's a bit of an obvious remark, but given that there are a number of such projects, it's important to take a look at some of the more compelling ones out there. One such important resource is the Southern California Earthquake Data Center, sponsored by a host of organizations, including the California Institute of Technology and the United States Geological Survey. Visitors to the project site can peruse some of its recent work, which includes a clickable map of the region that features information on recent earthquakes in California and Nevada. Equally compelling is the clickable fault map of Southern California where visitors can learn about the local faults and recent activity along each fault. Another key element of the site is the historical earthquake database, which may be of interest to both the general public and those who are studying this area.</dc:description>
                    <dc:description>The Southern California Earthquake Data Center presents a map of recent earthquakes in California and Nevada, searchable earthquake archive (catalog), a clickable fault map of southern California, and information on historic earthquakes (as far back as 1769) in Southern California. Information (Date and time; location; magnitude; fault involved; description; references) on each earthquake accompanies the map. Earthquakes are listed chronologically as well, and an alphabetical fault index is also available.</dc:description>

                    <compoundDescription>The Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC) is the is the primary archive and distribution center of seismological data recorded by the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) . The SCEDC web site offers information in the following categories: Seismicity ---Seismicity reports for 1993 to present ---Reports on specific earthquakes Earthquake Catalogs Waveforms datasets Station Info ---List of digital and analog stations in the Southern California Seismic Network ---List of TriNet stations ---Instrument response information for stations Other Data ---GPS and Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment data ---3-D Velocity Model for Southern California Education ---Investigating Earthquakes through Regional Seismicity Education Module ---Exploring the Use of Space Technology in Earthquake Studies Education Module ---Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country Earthquake Maps ---Maps showing recent earthquakes in Southern California and historical earthquakes in Southern California ---Monthly (1996- ) and annual (1985-1998) seismicity maps and animations for Southern California ---Animation of Southern California Earthquakes, M 4.5 and greater, 1932-1997 Maps ---Crustal Deformation Velocity Map for Southern California ---Seismic Hazards Map for Southern California - Probable Earthquakes 1994-2024 ---Clickable Fault Map of Southern California ~^ The Southern California Earthquake Center Data Center's mission: "To maintain an easily-accessible, well-organized, high-quality, searchable archive of earthquake data for research in seismology and earthquake engineering." At this site information is available on recent earthquakes in southern California. Automated maps with locations for earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or greater are displayed. Also, on this site: Historical earthquake information, and earthquake safety. ~^ To say that there are a few earthquake research centers in Southern California is a bit like saying that Chicago sits on a lake of some size. It's a bit of an obvious remark, but given that there are a number of such projects, it's important to take a look at some of the more compelling ones out there. One such important resource is the Southern California Earthquake Data Center, sponsored by a host of organizations, including the California Institute of Technology and the United States Geological Survey. Visitors to the project site can peruse some of its recent work, which includes a clickable map of the region that features information on recent earthquakes in California and Nevada. Equally compelling is the clickable fault map of Southern California where visitors can learn about the local faults and recent activity along each fault. Another key element of the site is the historical earthquake database, which may be of interest to both the general public and those who are studying this area. ~^ The Southern California Earthquake Data Center presents a map of recent earthquakes in California and Nevada, searchable earthquake archive (catalog), a clickable fault map of southern California, and information on historic earthquakes (as far back as 1769) in Southern California. Information (Date and time; location; magnitude; fault involved; description; references) on each earthquake accompanies the map. Earthquakes are listed chronologically as well, and an alphabetical fault index is also available.</compoundDescription>

                    <dc:description>The University of South Carolina offers data from the seismic network that stretches from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Atlantic coast. Users can view maps of earthquake activity in South Carolina since 1996. The website offers a synopsis of the Charleston Earthquake in 1886, which was the largest historic earthquake in the Southeastern United States. Visitors can find a catalogue of the earthquakes occurring between 1698 and 1998 and a map of the East Coast seismicity from 1973 to 2000 as well as publications, technical reports, and bulletins.</dc:description>

                    <compoundDescription>The University of South Carolina offers data from the seismic network that stretches from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Atlantic coast. Users can view maps of earthquake activity in South Carolina since 1996. The website offers a synopsis of the Charleston Earthquake in 1886, which was the largest historic earthquake in the Southeastern United States. Visitors can find a catalogue of the earthquakes occurring between 1698 and 1998 and a map of the East Coast seismicity from 1973 to 2000 as well as publications, technical reports, and bulletins.</compoundDescription>

                    <dc:description>We estimate the relative importance of small and large earthquakes for static stress changes and for earthquake triggering, assuming that earthquakes are triggered by static stress changes and that earthquakes are located on a fractal network of dimension D. This model predicts that both the number of events triggered by an earthquake of magnitude m and the stress change induced by this earthquake at the location of other earthquakes increase with m as \~10^(Dm/2). The stronger the spatial clustering, the larger the influence of small earthquakes on stress changes at the location of a future event as well as earthquake triggering. If earthquake magnitudes follow the Gutenberg-Richter law with b&gt;D/2, small earthquakes collectively dominate stress transfer and earthquake triggering, because their greater frequency overcomes their smaller individual triggering potential. Using a Southern-California catalog, we observe that the rate of seismicity triggered by an earthquake of magnitude m increases with m as 10^(alpha m), where alpha=1.00+-0.05. We also find that the magnitude distribution of triggered earthquakes is independent of the triggering earthquake magnitude m. When alpha=b, small earthquakes are roughly as important to earthquake triggering as larger ones. We evaluate the fractal correlation dimension of hypocenters D=2 using two relocated catalogs for Southern California, and removing the effect of short-term clustering. Thus D=2alpha as predicted by assuming that earthquake triggering is due to static stress. The value D=2 implies that small earthquakes are as important as larger ones for stress transfers between earthquakes.</dc:description>
