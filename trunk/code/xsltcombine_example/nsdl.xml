                    <dc:description>The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum offers 10 middle and high school educators ten interdisciplinary national standards based units. The detailed units cover a variety of topics related to baseball including women in baseball, influences of technology and society on uniforms, the business of baseball, geography of baseball park locations, technology of baseball, artist intrepretations of the game, and the math of baseball performance. In addition, two other lesson plans focus on the impact of such players as Lou Gehrig and Jackie Robinson. Each lesson is also offered in PDF format (requires Acrobat Reader).</dc:description>
